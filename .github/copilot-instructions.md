This is a .NET console application (Clean Architecture) that prints the latest S&P 500 index value from the database every 2 seconds, and fetches/updates the value from Yahoo Finance every 10 seconds. Use idiomatic C# with async/await for network/database calls, Entity Framework Core for persistence, and dependency injection. Use xUnit for unit tests in the IndexTracker.Tests folder. Follow best practices for Clean Architecture, repository pattern, and error handling. Exclude bin/ and obj/ from git.
